<h1>Pdf4Eclipse</h1>
Pdf4Eclipse is a pdf viewer which integrates nicely into the Eclipse workbench. 

<h2>Navigation</h2>
To navigate in a pdf document you can use the keyboard or the mouse wheel. 
Besides that it is possible to jump to a specific page number by entering it 
into the page field in the status bar.<br />

<h3>Outline</h3>
If it is included in the pdf document, Pdf4Eclipse can show the bookmarks 
(often more like a table of contents) of the document in the <i>Outline view</i>.
You can directly jump to a specific bookmark by selecting it in the outline.

<h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>
Another possibility to navigate in a pdf is by using annotations which are 
marked by a red frame in the document. By clicking inside this frame you go 
to the specified location. This could also be a web page in which case a 
browser window is opened.<br />
You can always go back to the last position by using the navigation buttons
in the task bar or the corresponding entries in the <i>Navigate</i>-Menu.
<br />

The highlighting of annotations can be turned on and off 
by a button in the task bar.<br />

buttons on the task bar or '+' and '-' keys. <br />
